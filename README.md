# HSRM_ZAMBIA
This was a course project for 2021 1st Semester ICU students.
## Academic Honesty
This repository is for educational purposes only. After I came across this project I decied to work on it for primarily testing my own understaing of SQL and PHP.
Should future ICU students be tasked to work on this project. I encourage them to try and work on the project on their own and not copy and paste code from this repository.
However, you can use thisrepository for reference.

## Health System Response Monitoring tool
**Funciton of the HSRM_ZAMBIA**
This tool analyzes COVID-19 response measures across provinces of the country launched.
The systems is designed in response to th COVID-19 outbreak to collect and organize up-to-dateinformation on how our country by province, district,
d town is responding to the crisis. it focus primarily on the responses of health systems but alsocaptures wider public health initiatives.

## Task 1: 50 marks
- Write the database structure SQL->DDL commands in note pad, the exercise is 30 marks from the 100marks of the project.
- You are then required to write the very commands on note pad then run them on XAMP or WAMP to create a database this process is 20 marks.
1. Design a database schema with the name **HSRM_ZAMBIA**
2. Design the following tables in the hsrm_zambia schema:
	- province
	- district
	- town
	- assign_province
	- response

## Whats SQL and DDL
**Strucured Query Language** (SQL). It is a standardized programming language that is used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them.
**Data Definition Language** (DDL) is one of the four SQL commands subgroups. It deals with database schemas and descrption, of how the data should reside in the database.
**DDL commnds:**  CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, COMMENT, RENAME

## What is XAMPP
XAMPP is a free, open-source cross-platform and easy to install web server developed by Apache Friends. It contains:
* **Apache HTTP Server**
* **MariaD database** and interpreers for scrips written in the
* **PHP and Perl Programming languages**

## What is PHP
**Hypertest Preprocessor** (PHP) is a widely-used, opne source scripting language. PHP scrips are executed on the server. It is free to download and use.

## FILES
[setup_hsm_zambia.txt](./setup_hsrm_zambia.txt): SQL->DDLcommand used to CREATE the database on phpMyAdmin.
[hsrm_zambia_tables.txt](./hsrm_zambia_tables.txt): SQL->DML commands used to CREATE the specified tables in Task 1.
